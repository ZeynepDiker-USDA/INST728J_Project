            Amigurumi dolls are hand-crocheted or knitted and stuffed dolls and figures. They can be figures animals, peoples, fictional/imaginary characters, and many other things. The word “Amigurumi” is Japanese in origin, and means, simply enough, “crocheted or knitted stuffed toy”. Here is a sample of amigurumi dolls I have crocheted over the last decade. This is a group of bunny amigurumis visiting the UMD campus.
